# Machine-Learning-Analysis-on-Loan-Status
The notebook presents several supervised learning prediction algorithms for loan status paid off or collected prediction on males and females, age, and there education level.
The dataset and initial pre-processing and visualization were given and presented through IBM Cognitive Class and the Machine Learning for Python Course.
Models and prediction algorithms with evaluations were done by me using SVM, Decision Trees, KNN, and logistic regression in Python through a Jupyter Notebook and the success of the models were evaluated using a hosts of measure including the Jaccard, F1-Score and LogLoss.
