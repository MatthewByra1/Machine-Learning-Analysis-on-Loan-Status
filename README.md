# Machine-Learning-Analysis-on-Loan-Status
Supervised learning prediction algorithms for loan status paid off or collected on males and females, age, and there education level.


Dataset and initial pre-processing and visualization was done and presented through IBM Cognitive Class and the Machine Learning for Python Course.


Models and prediction algorithms with evaluations were done by ME, Matthew Byra by using SVM, Decision Trees, KNN, and logistic regression in Python
